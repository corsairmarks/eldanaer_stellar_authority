 EMPIRE_DESIGN_eldanaer: "Eldanær Stellar Authority"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_eldanaer_desc: "The Eldanær are a polished, dignified species who actively cultivate an air of genial sophistication with outsiders.  Their long lifespans (individuals commonly live for centuries) coupled with a slow reproductive process led their society to form a rigid hierarchy that manages socio-political position, economics, and succession.\n\nTheir outward image belies a horrifying secret: the Elanær can only reproduce by slowly germinating spores inside still-living K'foori - the plantoid species that evolved sapience long before them on their shared, lush homeworld.  This is actively denied by the Stellar Authority, but whispers of the practice and the ubiquitous presence of servile and short-lived K'foori lend little credibility to the assertion.  Even more disturbing rumors have begun to surface: the Eldanær may be experimenting using other species as hosts."

 START_SCREEN_ELDANAER_STELLAR_AUTHORITY: "Millennia ago, our unintelligent genetic predecessor was but spores permeating the lush, fetid jungles of [GetHomeWorldName].  It began as a fungal parasite to K'foori - it overtook them from the inside-out.  Evolutionary pressures pushed our ancestor to hijack the developed neurology of its hosts and to develop sapience rapidly in response to the feeble, but increasingly desperate, attempts to suppress it with primitive medicine.  In the short span of a few centuries our species replaced significant numbers of our prepatents and built a new society on top of the remnants left behind by those we replaced.\n\nOur long lifespans yet slow and peculiar method of propagation lead our ancestors to develop rigidly organized nations that controlled access to K'foor breedingstock as well as inheritence and succession for individuals without genetic offspring.  Our civilization prospered and grew but so did the need for control of our lifeline, our prepatents.  As our species entered more a more intellectual era, our philosophers grappled with the necessity of the K'foori to die so that we may live while our greatest minds began to realize that our intelligence and even memories were built upon those of our individual prepatents and not wholly new.\n\nThese radical ideas and discoveries sparked strife and conflict between nation-states, but eventually lead to the imposition of global order by the strongest nation.  The K'foori were elevated from poorly treated stock to contributing, if secondary, members of our society.  Their fleeting lifespans combined with absolute information control effectively erased knowledge of the past from them within a generation.\n\nIt is this secret that we the [GetSpeciesNamePlural] must guard most carefully from both the K'foori and any theoretical xenos as we grasp the stars.  Propositions by the Theoretical Metaphysics Bureau describing a hyperlane \"network\" have been proven by the Ecumenical College of Applied Orbital Engineering by the recent success of their prototype hyper drives.  The dominion of the [GetName] is no longer restricted to [Root.Capital.GetStarName]!  But these successes may be a double-edged sword: exposure to other intelligent life is much more plausible than previously considered.  Whatever xenos we find in the void will not understand us, so we must hide our true nature behind the veneer of our rich and enlightened culture."

 tech_pk_spore_dispersal_desc: "With the realization of the Colossus-class starship and inspired by its potential to mount planet-altering weaponry, our biologists have an exhilarating proposal: we could weaponize our own lifecycle to necrophage entire planetary populations.  By employing advanced gene-tailoring techniques, our necrophagic spores can be engineered to germinate and mature rapidly while still producing viable fungoids.  Only a vessel with the size and power of a Colossus could saturate a planet with enough spores to guarantee rapid conversion of most or all sapient life."

They are inevitably inhaled by practically all resident sapient beings, where they germinate and rapidly form a lattice of our mycelium, aggressively converting their unwitting hosts into our species.\n\nOur species is largely unaffected, although exposure tends to \"persuade\" individuals to rejoin our society."
