 PRESCRIPTED_species_bio_eldanaer: "The Eldanær are a polished, dignified species that actively cultivates an air of genial sophistication with outsiders.  Their long lifespans (individuals commonly live for centuries) coupled with a slow reproductive process led their society to form a rigid hierarchy that manages socio-political position, economics, and succession.\n\nTheir outward image belies a horrifying secret: the Elanær can only reproduce by slowly germinating spores inside still-living K'foori - the plantoid species that evolved sapience long before them on their shared, lush homeworld.  This is actively denied by the Stellar Authority, but whispers of the practice and the ubiquitous presence of servile and short-lived K'foori lend little credibility to the assertion.  Even more disturbing rumors have begun to surface: the Eldanær may be experimenting using other species as hosts."

 PRESCRIPTED_species_bio_kfoor: "K'foori are the original sapients to evolve on Dærun (a secret carefully guarded by the Stellar Authority).  The lush planet provided for all of their needs so they did not advance technologically much beyond peaceful communities of hunter-gatherers.  However, the jungles were an ideal breeding ground for many types of fungus.  At some point, the genetic ancestors of the Eldanær began as a parasitic nuisance to the K'foori.\n\nK'foor primitive medicine was enough to defend against easily-detectable surface infestations, but had no concepts of internal medicine.  Over centuries the Eldanær precursors evolved to survive long periods of dormancy within prospective hosts and to germinate slowly, invisibly, and inevitably.  The fungus coopted and replaced a K'foor from the inside-out, which jump-started its own evolution to sapience and then dominance.  Despite tight information control by the Stellar Authority, even the most servile modern K'foor seems to harbor a deep sadness for what was lost."

 PRESCRIPTED_species_bio_zdremite: "The multiverse has seen fit to tie the fate of the Zdremites to that of the Eldanær.  These slow-and-steady lithoids are native to a particularly high-gravity planet covered in dense vegetation.  Zdemite society invariably develops into small independent enclaves carved out of the dangerous jungles of Zdrel, governed primarily by military organizations that maintain a tenuous status quo peace over the livable land.  While individuals are often slow to develop new skills and innovations, their long lifespan and generational knowledge bends towards technological solutions to create more livable space.\n\nTheir natural strength and steadfast attitude inevitably earns the trust and respect of the Eldanær.  Following a brief first contact/annexation war, the Zdremites integrate with the Eldanær and are entrusted as honored protectors from other, dangerous xeno influences."
