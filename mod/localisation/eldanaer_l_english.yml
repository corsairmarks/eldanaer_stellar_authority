 EMPIRE_DESIGN_eldanaer: "Eldanær Stellar Authority"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_eldanaer_desc: "The Eldanær are a polished, dignified species who actively cultivate an air of genial sophistication with outsiders.  Their long lifespans (individuals commonly live for centuries) coupled with a slow reproductive process led their society to form a rigid hierarchy that manages socio-political position, economics, and succession.\n\nTheir outward image belies a horrifying secret: the Elanær can only reproduce by slowly germinating spores inside still-living K'foori - the plantoid species that evolved sapience long before them on their shared, lush homeworld.  This is actively denied by the Stellar Authority, but whispers of the practice and the ubiquitous presence of servile and short-lived K'foori lend little credibility to the assertion.  Even more disturbing rumors have begun to surface: the Eldanær may be experimenting using other species as hosts.\n\n--------------\n\n§LIf you play the Eldanær Stellar Authority with both of its species (Eldanær and K'foori) exactly as they are pre-scripted, you will receive a small bonus.  At game start, the Eldanær will also receive §H$trait_natural_sociologists$§! to use their unspent trait point, while the K'foori will have §H$trait_strong$§! replaced with §H$trait_syncretic_proles$§! as well as replacing §H$trait_unruly$§! with both §H$trait_slow_learners$§! and §H$trait_deviants$§! to more accurately reflect their lore.§!"

 START_SCREEN_ELDANAER_STELLAR_AUTHORITY: "Millennia ago, our unintelligent genetic predecessor was but spores permeating the lush, fetid jungles of [GetHomeWorldName].  It began as a fungal parasite to K'foori - it overtook them from the inside-out.  Evolutionary pressures pushed our ancestor to hijack the developed neurology of its hosts and to develop sapience rapidly in response to the feeble, but increasingly desperate, attempts to suppress it with primitive medicine.  In the short span of a few centuries our species replaced significant numbers of our prepatents and built a new society on top of the remnants left behind by those we replaced.\n\nOur long lifespans yet slow and peculiar method of propagation lead our ancestors to develop rigidly organized nations that controlled access to K'foor breeding stock as well as inheritance and succession for individuals without genetic offspring.  Our civilization prospered and grew but so did the need for control of our lifeline, our prepatents.  As our species entered more a more intellectual era, our philosophers grappled with the necessity of the K'foori to die so that we may live while our greatest minds began to realize that our intelligence and even memories were built upon those of our individual prepatents and not wholly new.\n\nThese radical ideas and discoveries sparked strife and conflict between nation-states, but eventually lead to the imposition of global order by the strongest nation.  The K'foori were elevated from poorly treated stock to contributing, if secondary, members of our society.  Their fleeting lifespans combined with absolute information control effectively erased knowledge of the past from them within a generation.\n\nIt is this secret that we the [GetSpeciesNamePlural] must guard most carefully from both the K'foori and any theoretical xenos as we grasp the stars.  Propositions by the Theoretical Metaphysics Bureau describing a hyperlane \"network\" have been proven by the Ecumenical College of Applied Orbital Engineering by the recent success of their prototype hyper drives.  The dominion of the [GetName] is no longer restricted to [Root.Capital.GetStarName]!  But these successes may be a double-edged sword: exposure to other intelligent life is much more plausible than previously considered.  Whatever xenos we find in the void will not understand us, so we must hide our true nature behind the veneer of our rich and enlightened culture."

 PRESCRIPTED_species_bio_kfoor: "K'foori are the original sapients to evolve on Dærun (a secret carefully guarded by the Stellar Authority).  The lush planet provided for all of their needs so they did not advance technologically much beyond peaceful communities of hunter-gatherers.  However, the jungles were an ideal breeding ground for many types of fungus.  At some point, the genetic ancestors of the Eldanær began as a parasitic nuisance to the K'foori.\n\nK'foor primitive medicine was enough to defend against easily-detectable surface infestations, but had no concepts of internal medicine.  Over centuries the Eldanær precursors evolved to survive long periods of dormancy within prospective hosts and to germinate slowly, invisibly, and inevitably.  The fungus coopted and replaced a K'foor from the inside-out, which jump-started its own evolution to sapience and then dominance.  Despite tight information control by the Stellar Authority, even the most servile modern K'foor seems to harbor a deep sadness for what was lost."

These slow-and-steady lithoids are native to a particularly high-gravity planet covered in dense vegetation.  Zdemite society invariably develops into small independent enclaves carved out of the dangerous jungles of Zdrel, governed primarily by military organizations that maintain a tenuous status quo peace over the livable land.  While individuals are often slow to develop new skills and innovations, their long lifespan and generational knowledge bends towards technological solutions to create more livable space.\n\nTheir natural strength and steadfast attitude inevitably earns the trust and respect of the Eldanær.  Following a brief first contact/annexation war, the Zdremites integrate with the Eldanær and are entrusted as honored protectors from other, dangerous xeno influences."
